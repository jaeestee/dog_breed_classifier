## Running a personal server
These are the steps in order to personally run the server on a local machine:

1. Clone the GitHub Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/jaeestee/dog_breed_classifier.git
```

2. Install all necessary npm packages:
```
npm install
```
> Running with ``sudo`` may work better

3. Run the server!
```
npm start
```

You should be able to see the server pop up or head over ``http://localhost:3000/dog_breed_classifier``.

As this is an interactive server, any changes made to the files will automatically be shown.
